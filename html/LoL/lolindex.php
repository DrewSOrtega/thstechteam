<h1>League Of Legends</h1>
<div class="bodytext maint">
<p>This year we signed up for High School StarLeague, a League of Legends tournament where our teams compete against other 
high schoolers from around the country. In the first season, we had five teams compete, and our top team placed eighth out 
of eightyeight, With a score of 18. Now we are partially through our second season, but we only have two teams competeing.
<br/><br/>
The top four teams from each group get a chance to travel to california to compete locally against the other top teams, 
the winner of that competition takes home a prize of cash.

		<p><h3>FRC WILSONVILLE EVENT...</h3></p>

		<p>FRC Team 3192 left for Wilsonville High School to compete in our first of three FRC events for the 2016 season.</p>

		<p>We arrived on station in good order, completed admin check-in without issue and immediately got the weigh in and measurements completed.  The pit went together quickly and efficiently and it was not long before the inspectors arrived to ruin our day.</p>

		<p>First they determined that our arm we used to deliver our hook and line assembly to the pull-up bar exceeded the 15" outside the perimeter rule.  Despite several demonstrations that proved the "violation" was transitory as the arm deployed, the inspectors and head referee agreed and we found that we could not use our primary scoring device before we has even entered the field of play. </p>

		<p>While that was going on, we found that our communicator did not have the latest firmware upload and that our control station software was not the latest version.  More time lost as we loaded the machines with the latest and greatest. </p>

		<p>We finally got the machine software up to date but the evening was coming to a close so we had to shut down and head for home.  We would re-engage in the morning.</p>

		<p>At 0815 Friday, the doors were opened and we rushed into begin work on the machine again.  Another software upgrade (seems they were a series, requiring sequential loads) was required and more time clicked off the clock.  The solutions we had for the arm did not solve the perimeter issue so we had to work on correcting the problem in between matches.  The software load finally finished and we thought we were ready to go when we found that the comm devise on the machine would not talk to our driver station.  We replaced the comm devise and established communications.  We then tried to download our software load to the RoboRIO, the brains of the robot, only to find that it was not working.  Three laptops later, we determined that the $450 piece of gear was not going to play and so we began the long task of replacing it with our backup.  This task was exceedingly tedious, requiring us to replace the RoboRIO and associated mounting gear, re-wire all the motors, servos, cameras and controllers on the machine, download the new code, test each of the components on the machine and then hope it all worked to specification on the field.  Unfortunately, by the time all this was done, we had already been disqualified from the first round.</p> 

		<p>We raced the machine out to the second round, only to find that it was not fully tested yet.  It move a couple of feet and then decided to rest for the remainder of the match.  Now we were 0-2.</p>

		<p>In Match 3, we were more confident as we eliminated each of the bugs noted earlier.  The match started and the robot ran in circles.  Seems we had lost control of the left side of the robot.  0-3.  When we returned to the pit, we found that the USB connector for the joystick controller had disengaged.  Head slaps all around...</p>

		<p>In Match 4, we managed to drive about but found that our machine could not defeat the obstacles as easily as it has in practice.  Our mockups were made of wood.  The field elements were made of steel and Plexiglas, giving us a new problem... our treads slipped.  Something else for the drive team to work on...  0-4.</p>

		<p>In Match 5 we actually seemed to find our stride, defeating two elements and contributing to our alliance score.  Our alliance was outscored 62-48 but at least we weren't "that robot" that nobody could count on.</p>

		<p>In Match 6 we came closer still, getting our autonomous program running and actually helping one of our alliance partners by pushing them onto a scoring element they were sliding down.  We lost again, 57-55.  Getting better but still on the wrong end of the score.  0-6.</p>

		<p>In Match 7, our alliance earned a tie, 45-45.  0-6-1!</p>

		<p>In Match 8, the last match of the day, our team won a resounding victory, 78-35.  1-6-1!  It helped that we were allied with two of the top ten teams in the tournament.  We finished Friday ranked 35 of 36. </p>

		<p>On Saturday morning, we made adjustments to the chassis and drive system to facilitate our transit over the more difficult obstacles.  This would also make our autonomous program more effective and hopefully, make us a more attractive team for alliance selection.   And it seemed to work...</p>

		<p>In Match 9, we won.  In Match 10, we won.  In Match 11, we lost. In Match 12, we won.  We finished the seeding rounds 4,-7-1, 26 of 36.  After an 0-6 start, we had finished 4-1-1. We had overcome a myriad of engineering problems in a short amount of time and acquitted ourselves well.  Not bad... but would it be enough for us to get noticed and selected to an Elimination Round Alliance?</p>

		<p>The answer proved to be no.  We joined 12 other teams that did not advance.  Our tournament was over.</p>

		<p>So now we begin the process of improving our product in the limited time provided in the rules.  Based on the robot's performance on the field, there were several corrections that need to be made to our communications, our autonomous programming, our scoring elements and our driver training.  We have until our next event,  24-26MAR at Philomath High School to get it done. </p>

		<p>On an interesting note, Representative Susan Bonomici dropped by with one of her staffers to see our team.  She was intending to visit us at THS but when she heard about the tourney, she decided to come there instead.  Channel 12 and Channel 8 carried the event and our team was filmed with the congresswoman as we explained our machine and program.  Perhaps you saw us on the Friday evening or Saturday morning news...</p>

		<p>Representing THS this weekend were:  Tiffany Chu, Luong Hoang, Jorden Holland, Jason Holm, Jonathan Le, Abbey Lewis, Austin Liu, Kenny Luong, Austin McKee, Leon Nguyen, Sameer Raviprakash, Ian Roberts and Cole Swanson.</p>

		<p><h3>WILLAMETTE UNIVERSITY COMPUTER PROGRAMMING CONTEST</h3></p>
		<p>While the robots were rumbling, our Computer Programming Team was competing with the best high school programmers in the state for state bragging rights and one of the gaudiest trophies ever designed. </p>

		<p>The contest calls for a team of 2-4 members, using one computer, one keyboard and one mouse without any internet access, to code solutions to several CS problems over a five hour period. The teams are locked in a ballroom and served pizza and sodas.  Each correct solution earns the team ten points.  Coding the correct solution first earns the team an bonus point. Ties are broken by the judges who determine which team submits the "most elegant" solution- gets the job done in the shortest code possible. At the end of the day, the team that answers the most problems correctly, wins. </p>

		<p>Fifteen schools registered teams to compete.  THS fielded a varsity and a JV team.</p>

		<p>Our varsity team of Parker Chiapuzio, Delan Hoang and Mihn Duc Phan, completed the contest with six correct solutions which earned them a fourth place finish with 60 points.  There was a two way tie for second/third at 80pts and first place went to the school with 96pts- nine correct solutions, six bonus points for being the first one done. </p>

		<p>Our JV team included Kai Pinckard and Hoang Nguyen.  They were not considered in the final standings but they did correctly solve five of the problems for 50 points.  They will serve as the core of our team next year!</p>

		<p>Only the first three places brought home trophies so we were shut out of the hardware but this is our best finish ever.  A great foundation to continue to build on.  </p>

Tigard high has one of the largest and most diverse technology teams in the state. The students compete in many events throughout the year.
We compete in programming and robotics, with our team consisting of over fifty members. The Robotics portion of our team includes four
FTC (4097, 3965, 3058 and 750) and two FRC teams. We
introduced a League of Legends program. Last season we had five teams compete, now we've narrowed it down to two.
They are competing for prize money.
<br/><br/>

Tigard also has a very expansive Information Technology course selection. With six Microsoft certifications offered, as well as five CompTIA certifications,
the students leave with plenty of training. We already earned over 60 certifications this fall, and Mentor Graphics helping to pay for this years certifications, we are looking forward the upcoming season.

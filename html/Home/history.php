<h1>History</h1>
<h2>The start of something big</h2>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">In 2006 four boys with Stevie Vaine (Tigard High School Computer Science and Information Technology 
teacher) founded the THS Robotics Team. They started with a FVC (First Vex Challenge) robotics kit and 
received their team number, 750. Their efforts to build a viable robot were not successful and they did 
not compete in any FTC events that year.</h3>
<!--h3 is used for the year-->
<!--h4 is used for the heading of each paragraph-->
<h3>2008-2009</h3><h4>Intel/Trailblazers Engineering Challenge</h4>
<div>
 In the fall of 2008 Stevie Viaene retired and Steve Fulton inherited her job and the title of adviser for
 the robotics team. The Tigard Robotics team gained eleven more students and two private sector engineers 
 as mentors, which enabled the team to take the next step and participate in Intel/Trailblazers Engineering
 Challenge. The challenge involved building a t-shirt launcher that would be used during the halftime of a 
 Blazer game. The team elected to build a remote operated vehicle using the parts and materials they had on
 hand. Eventually they produced a single-barreled, pneumatic, tethered vehicle called "Long Tom" that 
 debuted on the floor of the Rose Garden. Tigard High School's first team did fantastic, being the only 
 team capable of shooting to the upper decks and were the only team with a remote operated vehicle.
</div>
<h4>FTC Season</h4>
<div>When the FTC season approached they found that they had too many people to operate on a single 
FTC robot. So the new Team 3058 and Team 750 worked through the winter in preparation for Tigard High 
School's first competition.
</div>
<h3>2009-2010</h3><h4>FTC Season</h4>
<div>
After working hard all winter Tigard High had two teams that went to their initial FIRST event, a FIRST 
Tech Challenge (FTC) tournament at OMSI. Team 750 scored well enough to advance to the state competition,
 but Team 3058 did not. At state, 750 won the Motivate Award, but was outscored in the finals.
</div>
 <h4>T-Shirt Shooter</h4>
 <div>
 That spring they became the Tigard High School Robotics Team and they used their new-found 
 expertise to build a more robust chassis for our t-shirt launcher. The team was also interested in 
 expanding our launching capabilities so they studied the various types of self-propelled guns. The 
 students latched on to the idea of building a launcher modeled on the US Army Multiple Launch Rocket 
 System (MLRS). By May they had a new robot in the house. They called their contraption TWAIN, an acronym 
 for Technology Without An Interesting Name. TWAIN made his first appearance during the Intel/Beavers 
 Engineering Challenge in May. The Beavers were so impressed that they paid them a stipend of $400 for 
 three appearances during the summer, money they used to pay for their next group of FTC robots.Oregon 
 Game Project Challenge<br/>
 In 2010, members of the Tech Team were engaged in the Oregon Game Project Challenge. Three OGPC teams
 of 4-6 members each designed and programmed games that were judged by game and animation industry 
 professionals in Salem. The teams earned three awards:Programming Award 1st, Game Experience Award 1st, 
 and Game R&D Award 2nd.Expansion of THS Robotics (addition of FRC)In the fall of 2009, the team expanded
 to over forty students and six mentors with over half involved exclusively with FIRST robotics. They 
 purchased another FTC robot and Team 3965 was born. But the seniors were not satisfied with the small 
 scale robots any more. Having participated in two Intel Engineering Challenges and appeared in several 
 sporting venues, they felt they were ready to take on a new challenge: FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC)
 .They were awarded a NASA rookie grant for FRC and with other funds from fundraising activities Team 
 3192 was established. With nine students and five coaches, they began.
</div>
<h3>2010-2011</h3><h4>FTC</h4>
<div>
Team 750, Gears in Motion, consisted of: Greg Collins(captain), Tyler Ross, Andrew Barnes, Tyler Woodward,
 and Casey McGregor. They earned  the Innovation Award for unique design at their first regional and 
 advanced to the semifinals at both regionals that they attended.
Team 4097, Data Virus, consisted of: MacKenzie Gray(captain), Margaret Lang, Aurora Seeber, Jennifer Deets,
 Laura Chapman, and Shannon Curb. They did not win any specific awards, but finished 3-1-1 in their second 
 regional and did remarkably well for being a rookie team.
Team 3965, Twisted Metal, consisted of: Thomas Woodward (captain), Joshua Zheng, Caleb Zheng, James Dolan,
 and Narin Luangrath. This team advanced to the state championships and finished 12th out of 24 teams at 
 the State Championship.
Team 3058, The Jury Riggers, consisted of: Phillip Nguyen (captain), James Anderson, Christian Wong, and 
Cliff Daniels. This team advanced to the state championships and finished 20th in state.FIRST Robotics
 Challenge (FRC)
FRC is an extremely intense engineering challenge in which teams are given six weeks to design, build, 
and program a robot that can compete against other robots in an engineering challenge. Unfortunately,
 upon arriving at the competition our robot experienced multiple engineering casualties and had a 
 disappointing finish of 54 of 58. Still, team members learned about electrical systems, propulsion 
 drives, power distribution, marketing, and team management while solving the challenge.
 </div>
 <h4>Oregon Game Project Challenge</h4>
 <div>Team 921, Nerdotransmitters, Addison Hoagland, Nikki Card, Kyle Arndt, 
 and Michael Yeo, brought home the trophy for Research and Development and were lauded for the "best 
 use of theme."Team 920, Gravity, Casey Gregory-Neuhauser and Evan Fairley, brought home the second 
 place trophy in the teamwork category. This was especially impressive because the team captain with
 all of the documentation had failed to show up on the day of the competition.
Team 919, TANSTAAFL, Holland Taylor, Alex Hoagland, Habib Fakih, David Astleford, and Andrew Barnes,
 brought home the Second Place Overall trophy and was .02 points away from taking first.Willamette 
 University Computer Programming Challenge Teams are given five hours to solve 15 computer programming 
 challenges. Our team was able to solve 4 problems with only one semester of computer programming and a 
 cumbersome Integrated Development Environment to work in. The top team only answered nine of the problems.
</div>
<h3>2011-2012</h3>
<h4>Girls Generation</h4>
<div>
Girls Generation Took TAZ to Catlin Gabel and let all the girls on the team have a go at driving it.  
They all had fun and learned a lot. Hosting on January 28-29, Tigard High School hosted two days of
 robotics tournaments for 45 teams from 35 high schools in Oregon and Washington. The teams competed
 for invitations to the State FTC Championships on February 25-26. The team did an outstanding job 
 hosting the event, keeping everyone on task and smoothly executing the largest FTC Robotics Tournament
 in the state that year. Virtually all the members participated and several of the school's teaching staff
 including Ken Teschner (Judge), Nancy Mayer (Judge), Rick Holmes (Judge) and John Weber (Referee), joined
 in with 40 other volunteers and parents to make the event one to remember. They received dozens of emails
 lauding the school facility and the people who made it happen: teams, coaches, administrators and school
 board members.The most memorable moment of the tournament occurred on Saturday morning. Two teams from 
 central Oregon arrived without their coach who was at that moment getting a marrow transplant in Nashville,
 Tennessee. The team coach was one of the team members' mother and she had no robotics background at all.
 Neither team could even run their robots, much less pass inspection. A THS Tiger Team was formed including
 Philip Nguyen, Tyler Woodworth, Riley Deets, Kail McGrath and two THS coaches. They rebuilt their robots
 in two hours, helping both team pass inspection and get into the competition. One of the teams did so well 
 they finished fifth in the seeding rounds and eventually won a ticket to the State Championships. As a
 reward for their efforts in putting on the THS State Qualifying Tournament, Teams 750 and 3058 earned
 automatic bids to the State Championship Tournament. 
 </div>
 <h4>FTC season</h4> 
 <div>The FTC robotics (small robots) teams
 participated as competitors for the first time attending the Evergreen Aviation Qualifying Tournament on
 Saturday.  At their conclusion, 4097 had finished 8th, 3965 had finished 9th, 3058 11th and 750 12th of 
 the 24 teams present. Teams 4097 and 3965 each got a trophy, and everyone gained lots of experience. St 
 Helens HS Qualifying Tournament, February 18. At their conclusion, 4097 had finished 8th, 3965 had 
 finished 9th, 3058 11th and 750 12th of the 24 teams present. State FTC Championships, February 25-26,
 South Meadow Middle School. At their conclusion, 4097 had finished 10th, 3965 had finished 9th, 3058 11th
 and 750 12th of the 24 teams present. FRC On 23 March, we moved our latest FRC creation, Crouching 
 Tiger, into Memorial Coliseum with all his support equipment (including a cool minibot, Tiger Bit). 
 We sadly suffered multiple engineering casualties to the robot that severely limited our ability to
 score and therefore compete. We finished a dismal 2-7, placing 54 of 58. . Taking on the challenge, 
 designing, prototyping, building, programming, testing and competing with the robot was the defining
 goal. We all grew from the experience.

 <h4>Bunnybots</h4>
 <div>
 In one match, we scored 10 of the 14 points our alliance scored

 <h4>Oregon Game Project Challenge</h4>
 <div>
 Team 920 and Team 921, headed to the 
 competition. Only Team 921 came home with the professionalism award.
 </div>
 <h4>SeaPerch</h3>
 <div>
 The team of robotic enthusiasts wanted to expand their understanding of robots. So they dived into SeaPerch and formed nine 
 teams, each being a three-person group. Since they were the only group in Oregon, except for INST Bruce
 Conway, that were participating in SeaPearch; they decided to host their own event. Luckily Evergreen
 Aviation & Space Museum - Waterpark, provided their facilities for them to use. It was all great fun and
 the team is ready for next year's challenge.

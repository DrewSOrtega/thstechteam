FTC is designed for those who want to compete head to head, using a sports model. Teams of up to ten 
students are responsible for designing, building, and programming their robots to compete in an alliance
 format against other teams. The robot kit is reusable from year-to-year and is programmed using a variety 
 of languages. Teams, including coaches, mentors and volunteers, are required to develop strategy and build 
 robots based on sound engineering principles. Awards are given for the competition as for well as for 
 community outreach, design, and other real-world accomplishments.

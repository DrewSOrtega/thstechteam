<blockquote><i>"The varsity Sport for the Mind," FRC combines the excitement of sport with the rigors of science and technology. </br>
Under strict rules, limited resources, and time limits, teams of 25 students or more are challenged to raise funds, design </br>
a team "brand," hone teamwork skills, and build and program robots to perform prescribed tasks against a field of </br>
competitors. It's as close to "real-world engineering" as a student can get. Volunteer professional mentors lend their </br>
time and talents to guide each team.</i></blockquote>

<!--<h3><i>This year's game</i></h3>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hTyCIYZQ_1s" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>On Saturday after the game release, we met in TNET, downloaded the Game Manual, made copies for each of the specialty 
teams and began to read. By noon when the rest of the FRC Team gathered for their reveal, we had inventoried the KoP,
laid it out for inspection by the team, read the Game Manual and developed a brief demonstration to further explain the 
FIRST video. With the majority of the team on hand, we watched the video once more, demonstrated the 2015 field elements 
and passed out the Game Manual copies. We then spent an hour reading the entire Game Manual in pairs, marking the copies
with questions for further discussion. When everyone had a firm grasp of the game, we divided into three teams. Each team 
was tasked with developing a basic robot design based on their proposed game strategy. After thirty minutes of brainstorming
, the three teams came back together and presented their ideas to the rest of the group. The teams all came to the same 
general idea- a maneuverable chassis with a fork-lift like devise on the front end to move and stack the boxes. At the
completion of the presentations, each team leader was asked to "formalize" their ideas for presentation that Tuesday night
to the assembled coaches and teammates, concentrating specifically on design capabilities and limitations.</p>-->
